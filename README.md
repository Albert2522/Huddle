# Huddle

## Minimum Viable Product
Huddle is a web-application inspired by Meetup. Huddle is a platform that promotes a community of users to plan, host, and attend events catered to their personal interests. Whether professional, informal, or just for fun, we believe that people should have a means to get to know each other if they are interested in similar things. Find your huddle and share your love of something with others who feel the same way. 

Huddle is built using a Ruby on Rails backend with React/Redux on the frontend. By the end of week 9 at AppAcademy, Huddle will satisfy the following features with a pleasant user experience (made with love for CSS styling and bug-free navigation) for all visitors to the platform:

- [ ] Hosting on Heroku
- [ ] New user account creation, existing user login, guest/demo login
- [ ] Categories (types/"genres" of Groups)
- [ ] Groups
- [ ] Huddles (events for a Group)
- [ ] Search by Categories or Group names
